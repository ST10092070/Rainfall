## Branch Naming Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Branch names should be descriptive and provide information about the
   purpose of the branch. A good branch name should convey what changes or features are being worked
   on. For example:
    - `feature/user-authentication`: Describes that this branch is working on user authentication
      feature.
    - `bugfix/fix-login-issue`: Indicates that this branch is fixing a login issue.

2. **Keep it Short**: While you want to be descriptive, try to keep branch names concise. Avoid
   overly long branch names that can become unwieldy.

3. **Use Lowercase Letters**: GitHub branch names are case-sensitive, but it's a good practice to
   use lowercase letters consistently to avoid confusion and ensure compatibility across different
   systems.

4. **Use Hyphens or Underscores**: Use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) to separate words in
   branch names. Both are widely accepted conventions, and they make branch names more readable. For
   example:
    - `feature/new-feature` or `feature/new_feature`

5. **Avoid Special Characters**: Stick to alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) and
   hyphens/underscores in branch names. Avoid using special characters or spaces as they can cause
   issues in some systems.

6. **Start with a Prefix**: Consider using prefixes to categorize branches. Common prefixes include:
    - `feature/`: for new features or enhancements.
    - `bugfix/`: for bug fixes.
    - `hotfix/`: for critical bug fixes that need to be deployed quickly.
    - `docs/`: for documentation changes.
    - `chore/`: for maintenance tasks.
    - `refactor/`: for code refactoring.

7. **Include Issue or Ticket Numbers**: If your project uses issue or ticket tracking (e.g., GitHub
   issues), consider including the issue or ticket number in the branch name. This links the branch
   directly to the associated task or issue. For example:
    - `feature/issue-123` or `bugfix/bug-456`.

8. **Be Consistent**: Establish branch naming conventions and make sure your team follows them
   consistently. This helps maintain a uniform structure in your repository.

9. **Avoid Personal or Temporary Names**: Branch names should reflect the purpose of the work, not
   the person working on it. Avoid names like `johns-branch` or `test-branch`.

10. **Delete Branches When Done**: After a branch has served its purpose and its changes have been
    merged into the main or master branch, consider deleting the branch to keep your repository
    clean.

Remember that clear and consistent branch naming helps not only the person creating the branch but
also team members who need to review and collaborate on the code. It also makes it easier to track
the history and purpose of each branch in your repository.
